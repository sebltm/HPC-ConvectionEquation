# This is an example gnuplot script for plotting the u
# values in first coursework assigment (advection equation).
# It is assumed that the data to be plotted are in a file called
# u.dat which contains 3 columns: x,y,u
# The plot is sent to a PDF file called u.pdf
# To use this file copy it to the directory containing 
# u.dat and run the command: 
# gnuplot example_gnuplot_file 


# Send output to a PDF file.
set terminal pdf color enhanced
# Set the name of the output file
set output "initial.pdf"

# Set ranges and labels for axes
set xrange [0:1.0]
set yrange [0:1.0]
set xlabel "x"
set ylabel "y"

# Set the aspect ratio to 1
set size square 

# Plot the data 
plot "initial.dat" with image 

# End of file
